| App has bugs which effects the CRUD functionality                                   | App does not meet the brief and doesn't work in the needed areas.                                 | Medium (in the first sprint)             | Medium       | Myself                                                           | Evaluate where the problems are by reading the pytest reports and resolve the issues accordingly.                                          | To decrease the impact we can make sure to design unit tests which cover the main CRUD functions of the app.                                                                            | Units test were written for the main CRUD functions.

This was achieved well in advance. ( two days before the deadline.) |
| Important credentials are made public on git which leads to a attack.
